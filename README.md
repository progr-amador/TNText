  In this exciting game, players must attemp to eliminate each other by placing bombs and avoiding them, and be the last one standing. 
  
  The players navigate through a grid-based maze where some walls can be broke by bombs and others cannot. These breakable walls can drop player collectable power-ups that can increase their number of bomb slots, the radius of the bombs they throw and even a rare and game-changing twist that grants increased life resilience, all of these for a limited time.
