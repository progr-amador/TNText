  In this exciting game, players must attemp to eliminate each other and be the last one standing by placing bombs and avoiding them.
  
  The players navigate through a grid-based maze where some walls are breakable and others are not. The first ones can drop collectable and temporary power-ups that can increase the players number of bomb slots, enlarge the radius of their placed bombs and even a rare and game-changing twist that grants them increased life resilience.
