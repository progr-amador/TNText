### DESCRIPTION
In this exciting two-player game, players must attempt to eliminate each other and be the last one standing by placing bombs and avoiding them.

The players navigate through a grid-based maze where some walls are breakable and others are not. The breakable ones drop power-ups that can be collected by the players in order to upgrade their fighting capabilities.
